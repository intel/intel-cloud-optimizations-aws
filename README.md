# Intel® Cloud Optimization Modules for Kubernetes

This module can be used to  build and deploy AI applications on the AWS cloud. Specifically, we will focus on one of the first Intel Cloud Optimization Modules, which serves as a template with codified Intel accelerations covering various AI workloads. We will also introduce the AWS services that we will use in the process, including Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

## Solution Architecture 

The architecture uses Docker for application containerization and Elastic Container (ECR) Storage on AWS. The application image is then deployed on a cluster managed by Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Our clusters are made up of EC2 instances. We use S3 for storing data and model objects, which are retrieved during various steps of our ML pipeline. The client interacts with our infrastructure through our Elastic Load Balancer, which gets provisioned by our Kubernetes service.

## Our Loan Default Prediction Application
  
The application we will be deploying is based on the Loan Default Risk Prediction AI Reference Kit.

We refactored the code from this reference solution to be more modular in support of our three main APIs:

- Data processing — This endpoint preprocess data and stores it in a data lake or another structured format. This codebase also handles the expansion of the dataset for benchmarking purposes.
- Model Training — This endpoint trains an XGBoost Classifier and converts it to an inference-optimized daal4py format.
- Inference — This endpoint receives a payload with raw data and returns the loan default classification of each sample.
  
The directory tree below outlines the codebase’s various scripts, assets, and configuration files. The majority of the ML application code is in the app/ folder. This folder contains loan_default and utils packages — the loan_default package contains the server-side python modules that support our three main APIs. The server.py script contains the FastAPI endpoint configurations, payload data models, and commands to start a uvicorn server.

## Configuring and Launching Elastic Kubernetes Service Clusters

Elastic Kubernetes Service is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It eliminates the need to install, operate, and scale Kubernetes clusters on your own infrastructure.

To launch our EKS cluster, we must first create our cluster configuration file — cluster.yaml
  
```
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: "eks-cluster-loanDefault"
  version: "1.23"
  region: "us-east-1"

managedNodeGroups:
- name: "eks-cluster-loanDefault-mng"
  desiredCapacity: 3
  instanceType: "m5.large"
```

- We can configure the name and region of our cluster deployment, as well as the version of EKS that we want to run, in our “metadata” section. Most importantly, we can configure basic requirements for we compute resources in the “managedNodeGroups” section:

- desiredCapacity — the number of nodes to scale to when your stack is created. In this tutorial, we will set this to 3.
instanceType — the instance type for your nodes. This tutorial uses an m5.large instance, a 3rd Generation Xeon (2vCPU and 8GiB). Once openly available, we recommend trying out the r7iz instance family to take advantage of the Intel Advanced Matrix Extension (AMX) — a dedicated accelerator for deep learning workloads inside of Intel 4th Generation Xeon CPUs.

We execute `eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yaml` to create the Cloud Formation stack and provision all relevant resources. With the current configurations, this process should take 10 to 15 minutes.

You should run a quick test to ensure your cluster has been provisioned properly. Run `eksctl get cluster` to get the name of your available cluster(s), and `eksclt get nodegroup --cluster <cluster name>` to check on your cluster’s node group.
  

## Setting up all of the Kubernetes Application Resources

Let’s dig into launching your Kubernetes application. This process entails creating a namespace, a deployment manifest, and a Kubernetes service. All of these files are available in the tutorial’s codebase.

### Before moving on to this part of the tutorial, please:
- [Create a docker image using the Dockerfile in the application codebase and push it to the Elastic Container Registry on AWS](https://eduand-alvarez.medium.com/creating-an-ecr-registry-and-pushing-a-docker-image-93e372e74ff7)
- [Create and configure your kubernetes service account to grant your application proper access to S3 resources](https://eduand-alvarez.medium.com/how-to-assign-aws-service-permissions-to-kubernetes-resources-cb1e0257ca22)

### Once you've completed the tasks above, you can continue with the tutorial. 
  
A Kubernetes namespace is a virtual cluster that divides and isolates resources within a physical cluster. Let’s create a namespace called “loan-default-app” 

```
kubectl create namespace loan-default-app
```

Now, let’s configure our Kubernetes deployment manifest. A Kubernetes deployment is a Kubernetes resource that allows you to declaratively manage a set of replica pods for a given application, ensuring that the desired number of replicas are running and available at all times while enabling features such as scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks. It also provides an abstraction layer over the pods, allowing you to define your application’s desired state without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
  
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: "eks-loan-default-app"
  namespace: "loan-default-app"
  labels:
    app: "loan-default"
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: "loan-default"
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: "loan-default"
    spec:
     serviceAccountName: "loan-default-service-account"
     topologySpreadConstraints:
        - maxSkew: 1
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
          whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: "loan-default"
     containers:
       - name: "loan-app-image"
         image: <insert image uri>
         ports:
           - containerPort: 80
         imagePullPolicy: "Always"
```

The Kubernetes deployment manifest (deployment.yaml) above defines the following:

- kind: Deployment — The type of Kubernetes resource
- name: “eks-loan-default-app” — The name of our deployment
- namespace: “loan-default-app” — The namespace that this deployment should be assigned to
- app: “loan-default” — The name we assign our application
- replicas: 3 — the number of desired copies of a pod that should be created and maintained at all times.
- serviceAccountName: “loan-default-service-account” — make sure this matches the service account you created earlier.
- topologySpreadConstraints: — helps define how pods should be distributed across your cluster. The current configuration will maintain an equal distribution of pods - across available nodes.
- containers: name/image — where you provide the URI for your application container image and assign the image a name.

Run `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` to create your Kubernetes deployment.
  
Now let’s configure our Kubernetes service. A Kubernetes service is an abstraction layer that provides a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods running the same application, enabling clients to access the application without needing to know the specific IP addresses of individual pods. It also provides a way to load-balance traffic between multiple replicas of the application and can be used to define ingress rules for external access.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: "loan-default-service"
  namespace: "loan-default-app"

spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: 5000
  selector:
    app: "loan-default"
  type: "LoadBalancer"
```

The Kubernetes service manifest (service.yaml) above defines the following:

- kind: Service — the type of Kubernetes resource.
- name: “loan-default-service” — The name of our deployment.
- namespace: “loan-default-app” — The namespace that this Service should be assigned to.
- port: 8080 — The port where the service will listen to.
- targetPort: 5000 — The port the service will communicate with on the pods.
- app: “loan-default” — The name we assigned to our application
- type: “LoadBalancer” — The type of service we selected.

Run `kubectl apply -f service.yaml` to create your Kubernetes service.

This will automatically launch an Elastic Load Balancer — a cloud service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, to improve application availability and fault tolerance. We can use the ELB’s public DNS to make requests to our API endpoints from anywhere in the world.
  
## Here are a few tips before moving on:

- Run `kubectl get all -n loan-default-app` to get a full overview of the Kubernetes resources you have provisioned. You should see your pods, services, and replica groups.
- Run `kubectl -n loan-default-app describe pod <pod-id>` to get a detailed description of your pod.
- If you need to diagnose a specific pod’s behavior, you can start a bash shell inside your pod by running `kubectl exec -it <pod-id> -n loan-default-app -- bash` — type exit and hit enter to exit the shell.

## Testing our Loan Default Prediction Kubernetes Application

Now that all of our infrastructure is in place, we can set up the data component of our application and test our endpoints.

We will begin by downloading our dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset). The dataset used for this demo is a set of 32581 simulated loans. It has 11 features, including customer and loan characteristics and one label, which is the outcome of the loan. Once we have the .csv file in our working directory, we can create an S3 bucket and upload are Kaggle dataset.

```
# create S3 Bucket for data
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket loan-default --region us-east-1

# upload dataset
aws s3api put-object --bucket --loan-default --key data/raw/credit_risk_dataset.csv --body <local path to data
```

### Making HTTP Requests to our API Endpoints
                                                                                                  
We will be using Curl to make HTTP requests to our server. Curl allows you to send HTTP requests by providing a command-line interface where you can specify the URL, request method, headers, and data. It then handles the low-level details of establishing a connection, sending the request, and receiving the response, making it easy to automate HTTP interactions.

We will start by sending a request to our data processing endpoint. This will create test/train files and save our preprocessing pipeline as a .sav file to S3. The body of the requests requires the following parameters:

- bucket: name of S3 bucket
- key: path where your raw data is saved in S3
- size: total samples you want to process
- backend: options include “local” or “s3” — the codebase supports running the entire app locally for debugging purposes. When using the “s3” backend, the “local_path” and “target_path” parameters can be set to “None”.
                                                                                                  
```
curl -X POST <loadbalancerdns>:8080/data -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"bucket":"loan-default","backend":"s3","key":"data/credit_risk_dataset.csv","target_path":"None","local_path":"None","size":400000}'
```
                                                                                                  
Now we are ready to train our XGBoost Classifier model. We will make a request to our /train endpoint, which trains our model, converts it to daal4py format, and saves it to S3. The body of the requests requires the following parameters:

- bucket: name of S3 bucket
- data_key: folder path that contains processed data created by our data processing API
- model_key: folder where we want to store our trained model
- model_name: the name that we want to give our trained model
- backend: options include “local” or “s3” — the codebase supports running the entire app locally for debugging purposes. When using the “s3” backend, the “local_model_path” and “local_data_path” parameters can be set to “None”     
                                                                                             
```
curl -X POST <loadbalancerdns>:8080/train -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"bucket":"icom-pilot-test1","backend":"s3","local_model_path":"None","data_key":"data","model_key":"model","model_name":"model.joblib","local_data_path":"None"}'
```

Now that we have a trained daal4py optimized XGBoost Classifier, we can make inference requests to our API. The /predict endpoint will return a binary classification of True for high default likelihood and False for low default likelihood. The response also includes the probability generated by the classifier. In the codebase, we have set anything above a 50% probability to be labeled as a high default likelihood. This can be adjusted to return more discretized labels like low, medium, and high default likelihood. The body of the requests requires the following parameters:
                                                                                                 
- bucket: name of S3 bucket
- model_name: the name of the trained model is S3
- data_key: folder path that contains .sav processing pipeline file (should be the same as your processed data folder)
- model_key: folder where your trained model was saved in S3
- sample: your model inputs as a list of dictionaries
- backend: options include “local” or “s3” — the codebase supports running the entire app locally for debugging purposes. When using the “s3” backend, the “local_model_path” and “preprocessor_path” parameters can be set to “None”.

```
curl -X POST <loadbalancerdns>:8080/predict -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d ‘{"backend":"s3","model_name":"model.joblib","data_key":"data","bucket":"loan-default","model_key":"model","sample":[{"person_age":22,"person_income":59000,"person_home_ownership":"RENT","person_emp_length":123,"loan_intent":"PERSONAL","loan_grade":"D","loan_amnt":35000,"loan_int_rate":16.02,"loan_percent_income":0.59,"cb_person_default_on_file":"Y","cb_person_cred_hist_length":3},{"person_age":22,"person_income":59000,"person_home_ownership":"RENT","person_emp_length":123,"loan_intent":"PERSONAL","loan_grade":"D","loan_amnt":35000,"loan_int_rate":55.02,"loan_percent_income":0.59,"cb_person_default_on_file":"Y","cb_person_cred_hist_length":0}],"local_model_path":"None","preprocessor_path":"None"}’
```

## Summary and Discussion
In this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to build a Kubernetes application on the AWS cloud based on a high-availability solution architecture. We have highlighted the use of Intel Xeon processors and AI Kit components to improve performance while enabling scale with Kubernetes.

We encourage readers to watch for upcoming workshops and future Intel Cloud Optimization Modules (ICOMs), as leveraging the Intel optimizations in these modules can qualify their applications for an “Accelerated by Intel” badge.

Our goal with ICOMs is to help developers enhance the performance and scalability of their applications with intel software and hardware. With the increasing demand for high-performance cloud applications, it is crucial for developers to stay informed and utilize the latest technologies and tools available to them.
